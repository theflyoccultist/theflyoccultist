<h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Rin</h2>

I am a <strong>Systems Integration, AI, and Network Engineer</strong> in the making. My passion lies in creating robust, efficient, and scalable solutions, whether that's writing low-level systems in C and Rust, or integrating complex network and AI systems.

ðŸ’» While I started as a <strong>fullstack developer</strong>, specializing in React, Node.js and TypeScript, my current focus has shifted toward:
 - Systems Programming: Diving deep into C and Rust to build reliable, high-performance software.
 - Network Engineering: Exploring the art of connecting systems seamlessly.
 - Artificial Intelligence: Bridging the gap between machine learning principles and practical implementation.

ðŸŒ± I love the constant evolution of technology, and Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to grow. Whether it's automating processes, optimizing network infrastructure, or designing scalable architectures, I thrive on tackling complex challenges.

âœ¨ What sets me apart?
- A blend of high-level web development skills and low-level systems programming expertise.
- The abilit to pivot between building friendly UIs and diving deep into the guts of a system.

ðŸ“¬ Want to collaborate or chat? Letâ€™s connect and explore how we can create something amazing together! ðŸš€
