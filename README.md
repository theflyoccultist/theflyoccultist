<h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Rin</h2>

I am a fullstack developer specializing in React, Node.js, postgresql and Express.js. I mainly use Typescript to write my applications. I love coding because of the constantly new exciting challenges, allowing me to continuously learn something new. From making backend APIs to user-friendly interfaces, I love both sides of web development.ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently also getting into Machine Learning, and exploring how to apply those principles.

Want to work together or just have a conversation? Let's connect, and explore the possibilities!
