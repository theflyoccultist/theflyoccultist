<h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Rin</h2>

I am a <strong>Systems and DevOps engineer</strong> in the making. My passion lies in creating robust, efficient, and scalable solutions, whether that's writing low-level systems in C, or writing network utilities in Go.

ðŸ’» While I started as a <strong>fullstack developer</strong>, specializing in React, Node.js and TypeScript, my current focus has shifted toward:
 - Systems Programming: Commiting to C to build reliable, high-performance software.
 - Network Engineering: Exploring the art of connecting systems seamlessly, and writing infrastructure code in Go.

âœ¨ What sets me apart?
- A blend of high-level web development skills and low-level systems programming expertise.
- The ability to pivot between building lightweight UIs with a retro web aesthetic, and diving deep into the guts of a system.

ðŸ“¬ Want to collaborate or chat? Letâ€™s connect and explore how we can create something amazing together! ðŸš€
